# Contributing to _sogol_
Thanks for reaching this document. Contributions are very welcomed!

## Should I create a PR or an issue?
* Creating a PR:
    * Bug fixes
    * Increasing test coverage
    * Typos
    * Addressing an existing issue
    * Optimizations

* Creating an issue:
    * New features
    * Refactors
    * New tools
    * Changes to GitHub Actions

## How to create a PR?
### Fork
By clicking on _Fork_ in the top right, below your account icon.
### Clone & Rebase
You can now clone your fork locally and start to work on you changes:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:<USERNAME>/sogol.git
```

Create a new branch to work on. It will be more convenient to create more PRs if your _master_ branch has not "drifted" from upstream's (to not overwrite history).

In any case, make sure to rebase from upstream (this repo) before creating a new branch and before creating a PR to upstream.
#### Example
```sh
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my_branch
# Working on changes
# ...
# Rebasing from upstream
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push origin my_branch
```
### Create a PR to upstream
Now that your work is pushed to origin (your fork), you can create a PR to upstream.

Thank you for participating!
